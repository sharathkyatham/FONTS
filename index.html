            Dwarka is a town and municipality of Devbhumi Dwarka district in the state of Gujarat. It is located on the western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula on the right bank of the Gomti river at the mouth of the Gulf of Kutch facing the Arabian Sea.
            Dwarka has the Dwarkadhish Temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, which is one of four sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites called the Chardham, which were founded by Adi Shankaracharya (686717 CE) at the four corners of the country, was established as a monastic center and it forms part of the Dwarka temple complex.[1][2] <mark>Dwarka is also one of the seven-most-ancient religious cities (Sapta Puri) in India.</mark>
            Dwarka is part of the "Krishna pilgrimage circuit" which includes Vrindavan, Mathura, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Puri.[3] It's one of 12 heritage cities across the country selected under the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme of the Government of India to develop civic infrastructure.[4] <br> <br>
            The town has a hot, arid climate with a 16-day rainy season. It had a population of 38,873 in 2011. The main festival of Janmashtami is celebrated in Bhadrapada (AugustSeptember).<br> <br>
            <b style="font-size:xx-large"><u>Early history</u></b>  <br> <br>
            An epigraphic reference ascribed to Garulaka Simhaditya, the son of Varahdas, the king of Dwarka, is inscribed on a copper plate dated to 574 CE, found in Palitana. The Greek writer of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea referred to a place called Baraca, which has been interpreted as present-day Dwarka. A reference made in Ptolemy's Geography identified Barake as an island in the Gulf of Kanthils, which has also been inferred to mean Dwarka.[9]
            One of the four dhams (religious seats), which were founded by Adi Shankaracharya (686 717 CE) at the four corners of the country, was established as a monastic centre and it forms part of the Dwarka temple complex.[1][2] In 885 CE, the temple was renovated by Nrushinhaashrma, head of the Shankaracharya pitha (centre)

            Krishna is represented in the Indian traditions in many ways, but with some common features.[90] His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like Vishnu.[91] However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of which he is formed, both in India and in southeast Asia.[92][93] In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of Jambul (Jamun, a purple-colored fruit).[94]
           <b><i>Krishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, and playing the bansuri (Indian flute).[95][96] In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the Tribhanga posture.</i></b> He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic young boy with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.[97]
